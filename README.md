> **This “Pet Safety Leash” UI is a neutral demo skin for everyday usability testing.**  
> Under the hood, it is an **Offline Bluetooth Swarm Network** built for zero‑infrastructure disaster response.  
> When internet and grid power collapse to zero—wildfires, floods, hurricanes—devices self‑organize and keep operating.  
> No cloud. No cell towers. No accounts: local coordination, SOS relay, and continuity across nearby nodes.

# VitalGuard AI - Infrastructure-Independent Survival Framework (v4.2)

VitalGuard AI is a **single-file, offline-first** continuity demo that keeps **local decision support** available when **power and connectivity are disrupted** - with **no accounts, no cloud dependency, and no telemetry by design**.
**UI languages (7):** English · 한국어 · العربية (RTL) · 日本語 · Français · 繁體中文(台灣) · Español

**Format:** one self-contained HTML file (no build system; no external JS/CSS libraries)

## Release integrity (recommended for restricted environments)

**SHA-256 (approved artifact):** `f37502a9f511c856d4c6d720b93cac202214ff23e01280d7f69eabf33bdd3721`  
**File size:** 412572 bytes (~402.9 KiB)

Integrity verification commands:
- macOS: `shasum -a 256 VitalGuard_AI_complete_V42_1.html`
- Linux: `sha256sum VitalGuard_AI_complete_V42_1.html`
- Windows (PowerShell): `Get-FileHash .\VitalGuard_AI_complete_V42_1.html -Algorithm SHA256`

Why this matters:
- **Single audited artifact:** reduces runtime supply-chain exposure and "what exactly ran?" ambiguity.
- **Tamper-evident distribution:** reviewers can record the hash in a change-control memo (and optionally attach a digital signature) before use.

## Executive brief (60 seconds)

**What it is**
- A **local-only** web demo that uses **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity (RSSI)** plus **on-device stability logic** to support **short-range coordination** when networks are unreliable.

**What it's for**
- Demonstrating **offline continuity patterns** for disaster response / field operations:
  - proximity-based mustering / asset boundary alerts,
  - short-range search & rescue assistance workflows (BLE proximity - not GPS),
  - offline hand-off continuity between devices (encrypted export option).

**What it is NOT**
- **Not GPS** (no map, no geolocation), and **not certified emergency/medical equipment**.
- Not a cloud product (no accounts, no remote control, no analytics).
- Not a "tracking platform" (no central database; no remote admin).

**Decision question this demo answers**
- "Can we evaluate an offline-first proximity/stability workflow without introducing cloud risk or third-party runtime dependencies?"

---

## Main-screen pillars (field narratives)

1) **Extreme S&R (Avalanche/Landslide)** - BLE beacon proximity + on-device stability logic to support a radar-like life-locator workflow when responders are operating off-grid.  
2) **Upcycling E-Waste (ESG & SDGs)** - repurpose retired smartphones into offline relief nodes, aligning with ESG and UN SDG objectives.  
3) **Off-Grid Agriculture & Asset Protection** - practical patterns for livestock and asset safety in rangeland/desert environments with no coverage.  
4) **Arabic & Global Ready** - multilingual UI is built in (7 languages), including Arabic (RTL).

## Threat model (half-page, review-friendly)

**In-scope assurances (what this demo is designed to resist):**
- **Cloud / telemetry risk by architecture:** no accounts, no analytics, no outbound endpoints in normal use.
- **Runtime supply-chain exposure:** no external JS/CSS/CDN dependencies at runtime (single-file artifact).
- **Accidental data leakage during review:** data stays in browser storage unless the user explicitly exports.

**Out-of-scope / non-goals (what this demo does NOT claim to protect against):**
- **Compromised device/OS:** malware, rooted devices, hostile firmware, or untrusted keyboards.
- **Malicious browser extensions / injected scripts** (enterprise add-ons, spyware, hostile profiles).
- **Physical capture of an unlocked device** (or screen/shoulder surfing).
- **Hostile MDM policies** (forced proxies, certificate injection, restricted Bluetooth policies).
- **Radio-layer attacks** (spoofed BLE advertisers, jamming, RF interference) beyond basic stability heuristics.

**Operational takeaway:** treat VitalGuard as a **reviewable prototype**. For real deployments, pair it with device hardening, policy controls, and a formal incident/assurance process.

## Acceptance criteria (5-line "pass/fail" checklist)

Use these as fast, objective "done" conditions for reviewers:

1) **Outbound requests to non-self origins: 0** during normal use (DevTools -> Network).  
2) **External runtime dependencies: 0** (no third-party `<script src=...>` / remote fonts / CDNs).  
3) **Local data is removable** (UI reset controls clear browser storage for the demo).  
4) **Offline usability**: in Airplane Mode, non-BLE features (Help, SOS UI, local data) remain usable.  
5) **BLE scan stability (foreground)**: on a supported device/browser, scanning remains stable for an evaluation window (e.g., 10-15 minutes) with watchdog recovery logged if stalls occur.

---

## How to run the demo (practical)

1. Open `VitalGuard_AI_complete_V42_1.html`.
2. Use a Chromium-based browser that supports Web Bluetooth scanning (platform support varies).
3. For the most reliable BLE behavior, open from a **secure context**:
   - `https://...` or `http://localhost` (recommended)
   - Avoid `file://` for scanning where possible (many browsers restrict Web Bluetooth on local files).
4. Optional (recommended when policy allows): **Install as an app (PWA).**
   - In Chrome/Edge, use **Install app** / **Add to Home Screen** so the demo runs in a dedicated window.
   - This can reduce accidental tab suspension and improve operational stability, but BLE scanning reliability remains OS/browser policy-dependent.
   - Keep the app **in the foreground** during BLE operations.
5. Click **Add Demo Tag** -> register a BLE tag -> start monitoring.

## Key verifiable claims (audit-friendly)

| Claim | How to verify (5 minutes) |
|---|---|
| Offline-first / local-only by default | Open DevTools -> Network, then use the UI. There should be no unexpected outbound requests to non-self origins during normal use. |
| No accounts / no cloud sync / no telemetry | Search the HTML for analytics endpoints, external scripts, or tracking code. Verify UI has no sign-in. |
| No third-party runtime dependencies | Confirm there are no external `<script src=...>` libraries loaded at runtime. |
| Data stays on device | Confirm browser local storage is used. Verify nothing leaves the device unless you explicitly export/share. |
| Optional secure hand-off | If using encrypted export, confirm it uses AES-GCM via WebCrypto (on-device). |

---

## Platform compatibility (typical)

| Platform | Expected status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Android + Chrome/Edge | Best experience | Web Bluetooth scanning support is strongest here. |
| Windows/macOS + Chrome/Edge | Often works | Depends on browser policies and BLE hardware support. |
| iOS/iPadOS + Safari/Chrome | Often limited | Web Bluetooth support differs; scanning may be unavailable. |
| Locked-down enterprise builds | Policy-dependent | BLE and local storage may be restricted by MDM policies. |

---

## Limitations (important)

- **BLE RSSI is not a tape measure.** Walls, pockets, bodies, and reflections distort signal strength.
- Scanning can pause due to OS battery restrictions; the demo includes watchdog recovery, but background behavior varies by device.
- This is a **technology demonstration**, not a certified safety/medical product.
