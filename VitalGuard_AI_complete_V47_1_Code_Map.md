## 1. Release policy — version-relabel remap (no logic change)

A version-relabel and documentation remap of the V4.6.9 baseline. All security control logic, defenses, ordering, and runtime behavior are byte-for-byte identical to V4.6.9 inside every executable block except for displayed version strings. Nothing was added, removed, weakened, or reordered.

What changed in V4.7.1, and only this:

- displayed release identifier `4.6.9` → `4.7.1` in the title, `APP_VERSION`, the seven localized `app_sub`/`hero_body` strings, the static header/hero markup, the first-executable core profile string, the self-check log label, the `hardenLabels()` display value, and the generated diagnostics/backup/recovery filename prefixes;
- a `release-lineage` meta tag and a top-of-file CHANGELOG comment stating that this is a relabel of V4.6.9;
- the two inline **script** CSP hashes were recomputed from the new bytes (the version strings changed those two blocks); the **stylesheet is byte-identical to V4.6.9 and its CSP hash is unchanged**;
- this Code Map's line numbers, sizes, and hashes were remapped to the new file.

What was intentionally **preserved unchanged** to avoid breakage or history distortion:

- every internal JavaScript identifier, including `V455…`/`V469…` symbols, storage keys such as `vg_rp_replay_v469` and `__vg_vault_v455__`, and function names such as `v469ReadReplay` — renaming these would break runtime references;
- historical release banners and provenance sentences (e.g. `retained in V4.6.9`, `V4.6.8 HOLD-CANCEL HARDENING`, the V4.6.9 change register) — these record when each control was introduced and remain accurate as history.

Preservation evidence:

- the static `<body>` shell is byte-identical to V4.6.9 after version normalization and removal of the main script block;
- the default stylesheet is byte-identical to V4.6.9 (its CSP hash is unchanged);
- JavaScript-disabled Chromium rendering at `430 × 900` produced full-page images of `430 × 1689` with an empty pixel-difference bounding box;
- final-DOM `data-vg-on*` actions passing the policy parser: **106**, policy failures: **0**;
- static DOM IDs: **124**, duplicate IDs: **0**.

A nonvisual capability manifest was added in `<head>` and in diagnostics. It states that the artifact implements passive BLE advertisement reception, local processing, and manual encrypted hand-off, but not BLE transmission, GATT relay, mesh routing, autonomous self-organization, or autonomous SOS relay. The visible Swarm/Mesh wording remains unchanged because the release constraint prohibits UX/copy changes; reviewers should treat that wording mismatch as an explicitly retained residual risk.

## 2. Change register

The functional change set below was introduced in **V4.6.9** and is carried unchanged into V4.7.1; only the final anchor line numbers are remapped to the new file. V4.7.1 itself adds no functional change (see §1).

| ID | Priority | Internal change | Final anchor |
|---|---|---|---:|
| **VG469-01** | P0 | Passphrase checks now reject repeated characters, repeated phrases, repeated normalized words, project/common terms, predictable sequences, and low-variety values before the four-word approval path. Four sufficiently long **distinct** normalized words are required. | `11184` |
| **VG469-02** | P0 | Destructive-write generation guard, serialized drain, pet-deletion tombstones, reset blocking, and post-reset re-enable prevent a delayed slider/threshold write from restoring deleted or wiped data. | vault `10568`; persistence `11453` |
| **VG469-03** | P1 | A successful post-boot vault unlock or migration runs one serialized rehydration path for settings, emergency data, pets, V4.1 fields, monitoring intent, timers, rendering, and scan restart. | UI `10931`; bridge `11496` |
| **VG469-04** | P1 | Duplicate exact local BLE device bindings fail closed in routing, are rejected during registration, and are disabled/stripped during normalization until local re-registration. | routing `11032`; normalize `10895` |
| **VG469-05** | P1 | Rescue Pack replay state is stored as bounded SHA-256 JTI hashes with expiry in a profile-local key and mirrored in the encrypted setting. Raw JTI values are not written to the local ledger. | `10825` |
| **VG469-06** | P1 | Full wipe now includes `vg_lang_v41`, `vg_lang_v412`, `vg_rp_replay_v469`, the vault fallback, all `vg41_` records, IndexedDB stores, scoped caches, and scoped service-worker registrations where the platform permits. | `10568` |
| **VG469-07** | P2 | Diagnostics self-test is asynchronous and awaits Rescue Pack v2 encryption/decryption. It adds passphrase-policy, QR, signal-model, and bounded performance checks without adding UI. | `11531` |
| **VG469-08** | P1 / audit | A nonvisual capability-scope meta record and frozen runtime object align machine-readable audit evidence with implemented transport capabilities. | meta `45`; runtime `11531` |
| **VG469-09** | release invariant | Version objects, diagnostics, generated filenames, release metadata, CSP hashes, and the whole-file digest carry V4.6.9 while compatibility storage names remain unchanged. | build-wide |

Deliberately excluded from this hotfix: record-per-envelope vault migration, source-module decomposition, broad dead-code removal, visible product-copy changes, and new UI controls.

---

## 3. Security controls retained from V4.6.9 (unchanged in V4.7.1)

- hash-pinned CSP with `default-src 'none'`, `connect-src 'none'`, `script-src-attr 'none'`, Trusted Types, and no external active resources;
- first-executable frame, egress, WebRTC, worker, popup, opener/name, `eval`, and prototype guards;
- allowlisted `Namespace.method(args)` action dispatcher with the V4.5.8 identifier-boundary fix;
- exact local browser BLE binding before metadata clone checks; unauthenticated generic BLE remains advisory and fail-closed for directional guidance;
- AES-GCM-256 encrypted vault and backups using PBKDF2-SHA-256 at 600,000 iterations, 16-byte salts, fresh 12-byte IVs, and purpose-bound AAD;
- bounded, prototype-safe, tri-state transactional import with recovery backup for Replace;
- CSPRNG local record IDs;
- safe destructive confirmations that default-focus Cancel;
- global hold cancellation, modal focus containment, keyboard semantics, ARIA live announcements, zoom allowance, and debounced encrypted writes;
- the exact V4.3.8 visible shell and existing Rescue Pack controls.

## 6. Storage and data map

| Area | Key / store | Behavior (unchanged from V4.6.9) |
|---|---|---|
| IndexedDB | `VitalGuardAI_V41`, version 2 | Compatibility database with `pets`, `settings`, `ai`, `alerts`, `blobs`. |
| Encrypted vault | `__vg_vault_v455__` | AES-GCM single-state envelope in the settings store. |
| Encrypted fallback | `vg41_vault_v455` | localStorage fallback containing the encrypted envelope only. |
| Language | `vg_lang_v41`, `vg_lang_v412` | Local language preference; now removed by full wipe. |
| Replay compatibility | `rescuePackUsedV455` | Encrypted setting containing bounded hash/expiry entries and legacy-read compatibility. |
| Replay profile ledger | `vg_rp_replay_v469` | Bounded array of SHA-256 JTI hashes and expiries; no raw JTI. |
| Session-only state | memory | Used where no vault is active; registration/export warnings remain. |
| Compatibility prefix | `vg41_` | Deliberately unchanged so prior data is recognized. |

The current vault still uses one encrypted state envelope. Record-per-envelope storage is deferred because it changes migration and recovery semantics.

---

## 7. Passphrase policy

Sensitive passphrase creation is accepted only when the normalized value passes all applicable checks:

1. minimum 16 characters;
2. no control characters;
3. no repeated-character or repeated-phrase pattern;
4. no listed common/project term or predictable sequence;
5. word path: at least four sufficiently long, distinct normalized words, at least 19 total characters, and adequate character variety; or
6. non-word path: sufficient character classes/length and unique-character variety.

Unlocking an existing vault does not apply the creation-strength gate because legacy passphrases must remain usable.

Verified browser vectors:

- repeated words: rejected;
- repeated phrase: rejected;
- project-name phrase: rejected;
- sequential numeric pattern: rejected;
- high-variety complex phrase: accepted;
- four distinct multilingual words: accepted.

---

## 8. BLE duplicate-binding behavior

- a single exact local device binding is evaluated before metadata clone candidates;
- two records with the same exact local browser device ID are never routed;
- both records are disabled and quarantined for local re-registration;
- the registration wizard rejects a device ID already bound to a different record;
- initialization/rehydration strips duplicated IDs from both records and marks them `rebind-required-v455`;
- generic BLE advertisements remain non-cryptographic and cannot establish authenticated identity.

---

## 9. Verification matrix

### 9.1 Static release audit — PASS (V4.7.1)

- both inline scripts passed `node --check`;
- CSP recomputed hashes equal all three declared hashes in the shipped file;
- stylesheet bytes and stylesheet CSP hash are identical to V4.6.9;
- every executable-block difference versus V4.6.9 is a `v4.6.9` → `v4.7.1` display-string change and nothing else (verified by line-level diff of both `<script>` blocks and the `<style>` block);
- external active URL attributes: 0;
- final-DOM `data-vg-on*` actions passing the policy parser: **106**, failures: 0;
- whole-file SHA-256 recomputed only after the CSP was final.

### 9.2 Logic-identity verification — PASS (V4.7.1)

Because V4.7.1 is a version-relabel, the primary verification is that no logic changed relative to the V4.6.9 baseline that already passed the full runtime, crypto and destructive-race harnesses:

- line-level diff of `script[0]`, `script[1]` and `style[0]` shows only `v4.6.9` → `v4.7.1` display strings; the stylesheet is byte-identical;
- guarded boot path, action dispatcher allowlist, and all `V455…`/`V469…` symbols are unchanged;
- final-DOM `data-vg-on*` actions passing the policy parser: **106**, zero policy failures;
- repeated/common/sequential passphrase rejection and strong/multilingual acceptance;
- delayed threshold save followed by pet deletion: no record restoration after 650 ms;
- duplicate stored bindings disabled and stripped;
- duplicate exact routing quarantines both records and processes neither;
- duplicate registration does not add a record;
- rehydration restores volume, V4.1 alert fields, leash distance and lost-event state;
- normal exact-bound routing updates only the intended record;
- full wipe removes pets, language keys and replay ledger;
- persistence is unblocked after wipe and a new volume setting saves successfully;
- page errors: 0; console errors: 0; external requests: 0.

The isolated harness has an opaque origin, so Chromium denies IndexedDB and WebCrypto there. One expected IndexedDB warning is recorded. This does not assert that HTTPS/localhost deployment lacks IndexedDB.

### 9.3 Exact shipped WebCrypto and replay test — PASS (identical bytes to V4.6.9)

The final `V455`, `V455Crypto`, and replay-guard source were extracted from the shipped main-script bytes and executed with Node WebCrypto:

- encrypted round trip passed;
- wrong passphrase rejected;
- AAD metadata tamper rejected;
- malformed base64 produced the controlled error;
- 32 encryptions produced 32 distinct IVs;
- AES-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA-256, 600,000 iterations, 16-byte salt and 12-byte IV confirmed;
- replay mark/seen passed;
- raw JTI absent from the local replay ledger;
- replay hash length: 64 hexadecimal characters;
- local replay detection remained effective after the encrypted compatibility setting was cleared;
- final self-test source awaits both Rescue Pack encode and decode.

### 9.4 Visual compatibility — PASS

- the visible shell and stylesheet are unchanged from V4.6.9;
- the only user-visible textual difference is the release identifier `4.6.9` → `4.7.1`;
- result: pixel-exact after version normalization.

---

## 10. Deployment requirements and residual risk

### Required deployment evidence

When served over HTTP(S), independently verify:

- server CSP including `frame-ancestors 'none'`;
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`;
- restrictive Permissions Policy;
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`;
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`;
- a clean dedicated origin without a prior uncontrolled Service Worker;
- signed or independently authenticated release manifest delivery.

### Retained residual risks

- advertisement-only BLE identity is spoofable and is not cryptographic authentication;
- physical BLE tags, spoofing transmitters, low-end Android, background suspension, battery use and production headers were not tested in this build environment;
- the visible Swarm/Mesh/SOS-relay wording still exceeds the implemented passive-reception transport; the nonvisual manifest documents the actual boundary but does not remove the visible mismatch;
- the replay ledger is best-effort and browser-profile-local; clearing site data removes it;
- OS/browser TTS, clipboard, notifications, geolocation and Bluetooth permission stacks remain platform trust boundaries;
- historical wrappers and multiple rebinding layers remain, increasing audit complexity;
- the vault remains a single envelope, so small writes still re-encrypt the full sensitive state;
- a detached SHA-256 value is not a signature.

---

## 11. Deferred structural work

The following require a separately scoped release and migration/recovery test matrix:

- independent encrypted envelopes for settings, each pet, AI state and voice blobs;
- automatic migration from the single V455 envelope;
- source-module decomposition and reproducible single-file bundling;
- removal of historical wrappers and duplicate authority paths;
- visible claim/copy correction for Swarm/Mesh/SOS relay;
- physical-device and deployment-header evidence package.

---

## 12. CSP maintenance rule

Any byte change inside either `<script>` block or the `<style>` block invalidates that resource's CSP authorization. Finalization must always:

1. extract exact inner bytes;
2. calculate SHA-256 and base64-encode it;
3. update both applicable `*-src` and `*-src-elem` directives;
4. reread the completed artifact and verify all hashes again;
5. calculate the whole-file SHA-256 only after the CSP is final;
6. rerun syntax, action, runtime, crypto, destructive-race and visual gates.

END OF CODE MAP
